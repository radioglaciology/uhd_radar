The very useful page on managing conda environments: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

As a side note, there are a couple of configuration changes that I highly recommend:
1. By default, conda will automatically open up the "base" environment every time you open a terminal window. I don't like conda trying to take over my system, so I always disable this feature. It'll actually tell you how to do this when you install. Anyway, it's just: `conda config --set auto_activate_base false`
2. Conda uses "channels" to manage where you get software packages from. There are tons of channels out there, but there are basically only two you need to know about: the default set and `conda-forge`. The default set is a curated set of packaged that's supported and maintained as part of the Anaconda commercial service. `conda-forge` is a community-supported much larger repository of packages. In our case, the up-to-date UHD software we need is only available in `conda-forge`. Generally, I prefer to just get everything from `conda-forge` if it's available, so I just set this as my default: `conda config --add channels conda-forge`
