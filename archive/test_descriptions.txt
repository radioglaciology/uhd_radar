These are the modifications that I made for each of the radar tests.

loopback.bin: A single loopback test.

Test 1: 27m from roble, 55 rx gain, 325 freq, 1500 sums
     2: 27m from roble, 65 rx gain, 325 freq, 1500 sums (looks like there's cutoff)
     3: 27m from roble, 60 rx gain, 325 freq, 1500 sums
   
Test 4: 41m from roble, 60 rx gain, 325 freq, 1500 sums (cable was loose)
     5: 41m from roble, 65 rx gain, 325 freq, 2000 sums 
     6: 41m from roble, 67 rx gain, 325 freq, 2000 sums
     7: 41m from roble, 60 rx gain, 325 freq, 1500 sums (same as 4)
     
Test 8: 35m from roble, 60 rx gain, 325 freq, 1500 sums
     9: 35m from roble, 65 rx gain, 325 freq, 1500 sums
     10: 35m from roble, 60 rx gain, 325 freq, 2000 sums
     11: 35m from roble, 61 rx gain, 325 freq, 2000 sums
     12: 35m from roble, 62 rx gain, 325 freq, 2000 sums
     13: 35m from roble, 63 rx gain, 325 freq, 2000 sums. 

Test 14: 37m from roble, 55 rx gain, 325 freq, 1000 samples
     15: 37m from roble, 60 rx gain, 325 freq, 1050 samples (yes, 1050 not 1500. made a typo)
     16: 37m from roble, 62 rx gain, 325 freq, 1050 samples
     17: 37m from roble, 64 rx gain, 325 freq, 2000 samples
     18: 37m from roble, 63 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
   
Test 19: 50m from roble, 65 rx gain, 325 freq, 2000 samples (note: this may have been 55m)
     20: 50m from roble, 63 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
     21: 50m from roble, 61 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
     22: 50m from roble, 64 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
   
Test 23: 40m from roble, 63 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
     24: 40m from roble, 55 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
   
Test 25: 30m from roble, 63 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
     26: 30m from roble, 55 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
     27: 30m from roble, 55 rx gain, 325 freq, 7500 samples
   
Test 28: 40m from roble, 55 rx gain, 325 freq, 1000 samples (echo at 17 samples but for 40m the number of expected samples is 17.5)
     29: 40m from roble, 60 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples (am I getting 5 samples for direct path because of clutter? right over a parking garage roof...)
	
test 30: 50m from roble, 55 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
     31: 50m from roble, 55 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
     32: 50m from roble, 60 rx gain, 325 freq, 2500 samples
     33: 50m from roble, 55 rx gain, 325 freq, 7500 samples (not enough RX gain to see peak)
     34: 50m from roble, 60 rx gain, 325 freq, 7500 samples
